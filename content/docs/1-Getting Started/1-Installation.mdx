import PythonName from '@/components/PythonName'

## Python version

<FlamaName /> is perfectly compatible with <PythonName /> `3.7` and newer
versions. If you do not have any preference, we recommend the use of the latest
version.

As a first step, check that the version of your active <PythonName /> environment
is `3.7` or newer:

```commandline
python --version
Python 3.7.6
```

In case your version is older, we strongly recommend you to create a virtual environment
with the latest <PythonName /> version.

### Creating a virtual environment

This section is not a comprehensive guide about the management of <PythonName /> virtual
environments. We encourage users to learn more about
[venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv),
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) for a better understanding on how to manage
virtual environments. Virtual environments allow the user to isolate dependencies,
which plays a crucial role to avoid breaking compatibility between different projects.

To create and activate a virtual environment with a compatible <PythonName /> version
you can take the following code snippets. Before you start working on a new project,
it is very important to activate the corresponding environment. The last command line
in both code snippets precisely activate the environment with `conda` or `pyenv`,
respectively.

##### Creation of virtual environment with conda

```commandline
conda create --name flama-dev python=3.8 --yes
conda activate flama-dev
```

##### Creation of virtual environment with pyenv

```commandline
pyenv install 3.8.0
pyenv virtualenv 3.8.0 flama-dev
pyenv local flama-dev
```

## Install Flama

### Core

<FlamaName /> is a <PythonName /> library [hosted on
PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/flama/), and can be easily installed with
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (the package installer for Python). Within
the previously created and activated virtual environment, run the following
command:

```commandline
pip install flama
```

Now you have <FlamaName /> installed and ready to be used in your project.

### Extras

You have installed the core functionality of <FlamaName /> already.
However, you might need some extra functionality when working in your project:

- [Typesystem](https://www.encode.io/typesystem/):
  A comprehensive library for data validation typically used
  to define typed data schemas which provides data validation and
  object serialization & deserialization tools.

- [Marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html#):
  An alternative library to `typesystem` for data validation.

- [Forge (python)](https://python-forge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):
  An elegant library for revising function signatures at runtime.

- [SQlAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/):
  SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers
  the full power and flexibility of SQL.

These dependencies are required if you want to use typed data schemas
(`typesystems` or `marshmallow`), or if you are going to use pagination (`python-forge`),
or if you need to include a database (`sqlalchemy`) in your project.

If you use `typesystem` schemas, run:

```commandline
pip install flama[typesystem, pagination, database]
```

If you use `marshmallow` schemas instead, run:

```commandline
pip install flama[marshmallow, pagination, database]
```

### Development

If you want to contribute to <FlamaName /> development, you will need to install it
from the local folder where you have cloned the repository. Run the following command
if this is your case:

```commandline
git clone git@github.com:perdy/flama.git && cd flama
make install
```

<FlamaName /> is now installed. Check out the
[Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart).

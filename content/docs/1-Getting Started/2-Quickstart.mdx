import FlamaName from '@/components/FlamaName'
import PythonName from '@/components/PythonName'

## Hello ðŸ”¥

The way to start getting familiarised with <FlamaName /> is by example.
Let's start coding the simplest application:

```python
from flama import Flama

app = Flama()

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return {"message": "Hello ðŸ”¥"}
```

The code does the following:

- Imports <FlamaName /> and creates the instance `app` of this class.
- Adds the `route()` decorator to the user-defined function `home`. This decorator
  specifies that the function `home` will be called when a request to the route `/` is made.
  This will return the dictionary `{"message": "Hello ðŸ”¥"}`.
  [ comment ] - Defines the host URL (`http://0.0.0.0`) and port (`8080`) where the `app` will be served.

You can download this code in your `examples` folder by running:

```commandline
> cd examples
> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perdy/flama/master/examples/hello_flama.py
```

### Flama run

To run your first <FlamaName /> application:

```commandline
> export FLAMA_APP=examples.hello_flama:app
> flama run

INFO:     Started server process [78260]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

This command runs the [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) web server.
If you click now on [`http://127.0.0.0:8000`](http://127.0.0.0:8000), you should see
the greeting message `{"message": "Hello ðŸ”¥"}` on your browser.

#### What if the server does not start?

There are several reasons why the server might not start after running `flama run`.

If there is another service already using the port `8000` you will see an
error like:

```commandline
> flama run examples.hello_flama:app

INFO:     Started server process [54203]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
ERROR:    [Errno 48] error while attempting to bind on address ('127.0.0.1', 8000):
          address already in use
INFO:     Waiting for application shutdown.
INFO:     Application shutdown complete.
```

If you get an error similar to:

```commandline
> flama run examples.hello_flama:app

command not found: flama
```

that means the virtual environment where <FlamaName /> was installed is not active.
Activate the virtual environment (see [installation](/docs/getting-started/installation))
and try again.

Another possibility is that the application path (i.e. `examples.hello_flama:app`)
is wrong. This is the case when you have an error like:

```commandline
> flama run hello_flama:app
ERROR:    Error loading ASGI app. Could not import module "hello_flama".
```

The only way of fixing this is by providing `flama run` the correct application
path. In this example, the path must be `examples.hello_flama:app` given that we
are running <FlamaName /> CLI at the same level as the folder `examples`:

```commandline
examples/
â””â”€â”€ hello_flama.py
    â””â”€â”€ app
```

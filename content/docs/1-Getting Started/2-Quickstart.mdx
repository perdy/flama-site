## Hello Flama

The way to start getting familiarised with <FlamaName /> is by example.
Let's start coding a simple `Hello World` application:

```python
import uvicorn

from flama import Flama

app = Flama()

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return {"hello": "flama ðŸ”¥"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

The code does the following:

- Import <FlamaName /> and creates an instance of this class, `app`.
- Add the `route()` decorator to a user-defined function, `home`. This decorator
  specifies that the function `home` will be called when a request to the route `"/"` is made.
  This will return the dictionary `{"hello": "flama ðŸ”¥"}`.
- Define the host URL (`http://0.0.0.0`) and port (`8080`) where the `app` will be served.

You can download this code in your `examples` folder by running:

```commandline
$ cd examples && \
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perdy/flama/master/examples/hello_world.py
```

To run your first <FlamaName /> application:

```commandline
$ uvicorn examples.hello_world:app

INFO:     Started server process [78260]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

If you click now on [http://127.0.0.0:8000](http://127.0.0.0:8000), you should see
the `flama `
